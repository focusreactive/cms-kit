- Make sure pnpm package manages is [installed](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### Sanity
1. Create Github repository, create Sanity project, deploy to Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffocusreactive%2Fcms-kit&project-name=sanity-cms-kit&repository-name=sanity-cms-kit&integration-ids=oac_hb2LITYajhRQ0i4QznmKH7gx&build-command=cd%20../../%20%26%26%20turbo%20run%20build%20--filter%3Dsanity&install-command=pnpm%20i&root-directory=apps/sanity&env=NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN&envDescription=https://%5Byour-vercel-project-name%5D.vercel.app&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffocusreactive%2Fcms-kit%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fapps%2Fsanity%2F.env.local.example&production-deploy-hook=trigger%20rebuild)

2. Copy Sanity Studio and Next.js apps locally

- Navigate to your Github account and clone project repository locally.
- Navigate to project folder using `cd <your app name>`.

3. Pull required ENV variables

Execute following command to pull ENV variables from Vercel and replace some of the with local development values

```shell
vercel link &&
vercel env pull &&
mv .env.local apps/sanity/ &&
sed -i '' '/^NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN/d' apps/sanity/.env.local &&
echo 'NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN="http://localhost:3000"' >> apps/sanity/.env.local
```

4. Import templates and example pages data

```shell
cd apps/sanity && pnpm import-dataset
```

### Storyblok

3. Clone your new repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   ```

4. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

5. Install dependencies using pnpm:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

6. Navigate to the Storyblok CLI directory:

   ```bash
   cd apps/storyblok/CLI
   ```

7. Run the setup script,

‚ö†Ô∏è command should be executed from _apps/storyblok/CLI_ (previous step), to consume correct environment variables:

```bash
   node sb.mjs
```

8. Follow the interactive prompts in the CLI tool to:

   - Enter your Storyblok Personal Access Token
   - Enter your Vercel Personal Auth Token
   - Select your Vercel team
   - Choose a project name
   - Complete the space creation and configuration process

9. Go to project settings in Vercel dashboard
   - select **Git** section
   - create deploy hook and copy it
   - select **Environment variables** section
   - add variables called **VERCEL_REDEPLOY_HOOK_URL** and assign it to created deploy hook value

## Repo structure

- `apps/storyblok`: CMS app
- `apps/sanity`: CMS app
- `packages/ui`: UI components library, shared between both CMS apps
- `packages/eslint-config`: shared `eslint` configurations
- `packages/ts-config`: shared `ts-config` configuration
- `packages/tailwind-config`: shared `tailwind` configuration

### Types of components

- **UI component** - universal and sharable component between multiple CMSs
- **Controller component** - takes data from CMS, convert it to UI component format, and use UI component with converted props. Each CMS has it's own controller component for each UI component.
- All **controller components** have common propertiers to change style, such as margin, background, alignment etc.

### Components composition and hierarchy

The website structure follows a clear hierarchical composition:

1. Pages

   - Top-level components that represent entire web pages
   - Each page contains multiple sections, SEO properties and theme

2. Sections

   - Container components that organize content into distinct areas
   - Can be configured with settings like margin, background, width, alignment etc.
   - Hold and arrange other components

3. Base Components

   - Components like **link**, **image**, and **rich text**
   - Combination of multiple functional components like **card**
   - Can be combined and reused across different sections

**RichText** component has additional functionality. It allows to add sections inside, which gives ability to combine sections with text.

### Add new section

1. Create new component using generators

```bash
pnpm gen
```

2. Select type of component to create

```bash
- UI: Create a new UI component
- Storyblok: Create a new content section
- Sanity: Create a new content section
```

3. Enter name of the component
4. For Storyblok, add section component to the CMS
5. Update properties and design
6. Go to CMS folder

```bash
cd apps/storyblok
```

or

```bash
cd apps/sanity
```

7. Generate types for added section

```bash
pnpm sb-login

pnpm gen:types
```

### Update existing section

2. Update fields
3. Go to CMS folder

```bash
cd apps/storyblok
```

.env

```bash
REPO_PROD_BRANCH="main"
REPO_TYPE="github"
REPO_ID="[repo id]"
